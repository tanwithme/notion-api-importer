# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in improving the Notion API Importer! This project is maintained by volunteers. Before opening a pull request:

1. **Discuss**: Open an issue or comment on an existing one to describe the problem or feature.
2. **Branch off main**: Create a new branch with a descriptive name.
3. **Follow coding standards**: Run `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run format`. Ensure TypeScript builds with no errors.
4. **Add tests** (if applicable): Place tests under `tests/` using Jest. Current coverage is minimal; new features should include test cases.
5. **Include documentation**: Update the README or comments when you introduce new behaviour.
6. **Submit a pull request**: Fill out the PR template and describe what you did. Link to any related issues.

By contributing you agree to release your code under the MIT license. Do not include proprietary data or secrets (e.g., your Notion token). Use placeholders such as `NOTION_TOKEN` in examples.
